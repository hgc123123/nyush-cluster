## Basic Linux

The BIH HPC uses CentOS Linux.
**A basic understanding of Linux is required.**
Even better, you should already have intermediate to advanced Linux/Unix skills.

**BIH HPC IT cannot provide you with basic Unix training.**
Please ask your home organization (e.g., Charite or MDC) to provide you with basic Linux training.

That said, here are some resources that we find useful:

# Getting Access
Access to the NYU Shanghai HPC cluster is conceptually based on **user groups** (also known as labs or units).
Users have a relatively limited storage quota within their private home folder and scratch folder.

Independent group leaders at NYU Shanghai can request a **group** on the cluster and name group **members**. 
The work group **leader** (the group PI) bears the responsibility for the group's **members** and ensures that [cluster policies and etiquette](./policies.md) are followed.
In brief: Fair usage rules apply and the cluster is not to be abused for unethical or illegal purposes.
Major and/or continued violations may lead to exclusion of the entire group.  

## Work Groups and Users
All cluster users are member of exactly one primary work group.
This affiliation is usually defined by real life organisational structures within NYU Shanghai.
Leaders of independent research groups (PIs) can apply for a new cluster work group as follows:

1. The group leader sends an email to shanghai.it.help@nyu.edu and includes the filled-out form below.
   Please read the notes box before sending.
2. The HPC helpdesk decides on the request and creates corresponding objects on the cluster (users, groups).
3. New users are notified and sent further instructions via email.

!!! warning "Important"
    Changes to an existing group (adding new users, changes in resources, etc.) can only be requested by group leaders.


!!! note "Notes"
    - All cluster groups must have an owner.
    - Group ownership implies control but also accountability for their group files and members.
    - Users can only be members of one primary work group.
    - We **strongly** dis-encourage on-boarding non-lab members into your group.
      This cause biases in usage accounting, may raise concerns in IT security and data privacy audits and also puts unfair responsibilities on the group leader.

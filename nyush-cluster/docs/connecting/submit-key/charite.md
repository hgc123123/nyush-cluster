Click the "SSH Keys" button.

Paste your SSH key (starting with `ssh-rsa`) and ending with the label (usually your email, e.g., `john.doe@charite.de`) into the box (1) and press append (2). By default, the key can be found in the file `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` in Linux. If you generated the key in Windows, please paste the copied key from the text box.
Repeat as necessary.
Optionally, go back to the main menu (3) when done.

If you have generated your SSH key with PuTTy, you must right click on the ppk-file, then choose "Edit with PuTTYgen" in the right click menu. Enter your passphrase. Then copy the SSH key out of the upper box (already highlighted in blue).

!!! important "Check if the key has been added"

    After you clicked `append`, your key will be printed back to you (as shown in the blurred picture above).

    **If your key is not printed back to you then adding the SSH key to zugang.charite.de was not successful.**
    In this case please contact helpdesk@charite.de for assistance as they (Charite GB IT) maintains that system and it is out of our (BIH HPC IT) control.

Once your key has been added, it will take a few minutes for the changes to go live.
